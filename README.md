# 🕵️‍♂️ Undetectable Fingerprint Browser  

[中文介绍](https://github.com/itbrowser-net/undetectable-fingerprint-browser/blob/main/README_zh.md)

**Open Source · Modular · Programmable Anti-Detection Browser**

**Undetectable Fingerprint Browser** is a **highly customizable, realistically emulated, automation-friendly** anti-detection browser, specifically designed to counter modern websites' advanced fingerprinting and detection systems.

Whether you're engaged in **anti-anti-scraping research, marketing analytics, multi-account management**, or need to build a **fully controllable browser automation environment**, this project is your ultimate choice.

## 🚀 Key Highlights

### 🧠 1. Comprehensive Fingerprint Spoofing

> Not just spoofing more — but spoofing better and more realistically, with global consistency.

| Fingerprint Type         | Feature Description |
|--------------------------|---------------------|
| **Canvas Fingerprint**   | Precision spoofing, random noise, custom rendering results |
| **WebGL & WebGL2**       | Fake GPU models, render returns, renderer strings, antialias settings |
| **AudioContext Fingerprint** | Alters audio behavior to return stable spoofed results |
| **ClientRects / DOMRect** | Emulates browser-specific rendering differences |
| **Font Fingerprint**     | Controls font detection responses to block OS font probing |
| **Timezone / Language**  | Global override of `navigator`, `Intl API`, `Date` outputs |
| **Hardware Concurrency** | Custom CPU core count |
| **Device Memory**        | Spoof `navigator.deviceMemory` values |
| **Screen Resolution & Color Depth** | Simulates different screen sizes and color depths |
| **Touch / Mobile Indicators** | Emulates mobile device indicators: touch events, UA, media queries |

👉 **Exclusive Feature: Consistency Analysis Engine** ensures all spoofing fields align logically and do not conflict, eliminating detection signals at the root.

### 🧩 2. Fully Supported & Built-in Modules

We’ve integrated a complete anti-leak system — no extra installation required for:

- ✅ WebRTC leak prevention  
- ✅ Auto-adaptive Canvas/WebGL spoofing  
- ✅ Automation module (Puppeteer / Playwright compatible)  
- ✅ Built-in proxy injection (SOCKS5, HTTP, TLS proxy)  
- ✅ GPS & sensor data emulation  
- ✅ Local JS injection with CSP bypass support

### 🤖 3. Automation-Ready

Seamlessly integrate this browser into any automation pipeline, or fully control it programmatically.

#### 🤝 Full Framework Compatibility:

- Just add a startup parameter — no need to modify code.
- Puppeteer: Works by pointing to custom Chromium binary  
- Playwright: Fully compatible with Chromium engine  
- DevTools Protocol and WebSocket control support  
- JavaScript API and CLI tools for advanced tuning and scripting
