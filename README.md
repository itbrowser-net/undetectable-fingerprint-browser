## üöÄ Key Highlights

### üß† 1. Comprehensive Fingerprint Spoofing

> Not just spoofing more ‚Äî but spoofing better and more realistically, with global consistency.

| Fingerprint Type         | Feature Description |
|--------------------------|---------------------|
| **Canvas Fingerprint**   | Precision spoofing, random noise, custom rendering results |
| **WebGL & WebGL2**       | Fake GPU models, render returns, renderer strings, antialias settings |
| **AudioContext Fingerprint** | Alters audio behavior to return stable spoofed results |
| **ClientRects / DOMRect** | Emulates browser-specific rendering differences |
| **Font Fingerprint**     | Controls font detection responses to block OS font probing |
| **Timezone / Language**  | Global override of `navigator`, `Intl API`, `Date` outputs |
| **Hardware Concurrency** | Custom CPU core count |
| **Device Memory**        | Spoof `navigator.deviceMemory` values |
| **Screen Resolution & Color Depth** | Simulates different screen sizes and color depths |
| **Touch / Mobile Indicators** | Emulates mobile device indicators: touch events, UA, media queries |

üëâ **Exclusive Feature: Consistency Analysis Engine** ensures all spoofing fields align logically and do not conflict, eliminating detection signals at the root.

### üß© 2. Fully Supported & Built-in Modules

We‚Äôve integrated a complete anti-leak system ‚Äî no extra installation required for:

- ‚úÖ WebRTC leak prevention  
- ‚úÖ Auto-adaptive Canvas/WebGL spoofing  
- ‚úÖ Automation module (Puppeteer / Playwright compatible)  
- ‚úÖ Built-in proxy injection (SOCKS5, HTTP, TLS proxy)  
- ‚úÖ GPS & sensor data emulation  
- ‚úÖ Local JS injection with CSP bypass support

### ü§ñ 3. Automation-Ready

Seamlessly integrate this browser into any automation pipeline, or fully control it programmatically.

#### ü§ù Full Framework Compatibility:

- Just add a startup parameter ‚Äî no need to modify code.
- Puppeteer: Works by pointing to custom Chromium binary  
- Playwright: Fully compatible with Chromium engine  
- DevTools Protocol and WebSocket control support  
- JavaScript API and CLI tools for advanced tuning and scripting

#### üß™ Sample Usage (JS API):

```js
const browser = await launch({
  proxy: 'socks5://user1:password2@127.0.0.1:9050',
  itbrowser: 'chrome-114-win10-en-US.json',
});
```
